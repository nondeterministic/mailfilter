Mailfilter NEWS (Summary)
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

mailfilter 0.8.3 (under development)

  - Fix build problems due to bison not supporting YYPARSE_PARAM
    any longer.

  - Minor fixes to allow compilation with recent GCC versions.

  - Due to popular demand: Added option -i to ignore invalid
    Message-ID time stamps.  (Using this option is a potential
    security risk, so do not use unless you know better!)

mailfilter 0.8.2 (Sat Aug 15 16:12:22 EST 2009)

  - Provide fix for APOP vulnerability (e.g., described in ticket
    #2846 on mutt mailing list)

  - Fix build problems such that mailfilter compiles with recent
    gcc and autotools (mainly for developers)


mailfilter 0.8.1 (Sat Sep 15 17:14:49 EST 2007) [stable version]

  - Detection of getopt should now work when compiling the program
    from source (Thanks to Mike Clarke for helping me debug this)

  - Fixed logging error; no log files were created occasionally

  - Mailfilter now returns -1 if one or more accounts failed to be
    checked; 0 is only returned if the *entire* mailfilter session
    was successful (Thanks to Mike Clarke for pointing this out)


mailfilter 0.8 (Mon Jan  1 16:09:52 CET 2007) [stable version]

  - Code overhaul to introduce a more object oriented design

  - Temporarily disabled gettext and the outdated translations

  - (Hopefully) fixed bugs #238273 and #238273 in Debian bug database


mailfilter 0.7.2  (Sun Oct  1 10:17:41 CEST 2006) [development version]

  - Fixed a number of small build and dependency problems

  - Makefile clean-up: should now compile with old GNU flex 2.5.4
    again (?)

  - New user contributed scripts in contrib/


mailfilter 0.7.1  (Sat Nov 27 14:24:08 CET 2004) [development version]

  - RUDIMENTARY IMAP support  (not usable yet)

  - Preliminary support for SSL has been added
    (if OpenSSL is installed, it can be enabled by specifying protocol
    "pop3/ssl", or "apop/ssl" and by using port 995 in case of POP,
    instead of 110)

  - APOP support has been ported over to the 0.7.x development branch

  - MAXLENGTH keyword default is no longer ignored, or misinterpreted


mailfilter 0.7  (Sat Feb 14 17:59:26 CET 2004) [development version]

  - Revised and faster networking code

  - New rcfile parsing and setup capabilities
    Note, the rcfile format has changed!  Parameter strings have to be
    in quotes now, e.g.
    
    SERVER = "my.server"
  
    This also hits all your created rules. It is not necessary if your
    parameter is a number e.g. the port number.
  
  - New keyword MAXSCORE_SCORE (see man pages)

  - Keyword SHOW_HEADERS expects a path name now, indicating where
    to store the headers

  - Verbosity levels have been adjusted slightly


mailfilter 0.6.2 (Sun Aug  8 14:17:18 CEST 2004) [stable version]

  - Fixed a crash which would occur if the Date field contains no
      ":" separator

mailfilter 0.5.2  (Sat Oct 11 12:00:05 CEST 2003) [development version]

  - (Buggy) Windows support has been removed

  - (Hopefully) resolved compile problems: since mailfilter does not
    compile with GNU-flex anymore, the code has been adjusted to depend
    on a flex version which is available from http://lex.sf.net/

  - New user-contributions and scripts in contrib/
  
  - Minor documentation changes in the FAQ


mailfilter 0.5.1  (Sat Apr 12 08:46:25 CEST 2003) [development version]

    be used in combination with mailfilter (read its README file for
    further details)

  - Improved rcfile parsing and added support for multi-case keywords
    and the like

  - Updated and corrected the program's FAQ (e. g. thanks to Brian
    Hall we have now an example shell script that shows how Mailfilter

mailfilter 0.0.4  (Tue Dec 19 17:11:33 GMT+1 2000)

  A small but nasty bug made Mailfilter crash on certain versions of glibc.
  That's fixed now and also the reason why 0.0.4 was out so quickly after
  0.0.3 has been shipped.
  Mailfilter now allows ',' in the passwords and reports if the password
  that was sent to the server was incorrect.


mailfilter 0.0.3  (Thu Dec 14 16:31:46 GMT+1 2000):

  It doesn't hurt anymore having e-mails that match two or more filters at
  once.
  Added support for anal mail servers such as IMail.
  Various little bug fixes, mainly dealing with internal memory management,
  but also exception and error handling.
  Added a manual page.
  Added the ability to have case insensitive regular expression
  matching in the .mailfilterrc file (courtesy Ivan Vitjuk)
  Added api documentation in various formats


mailfilter 0.0.2  (Fri Nov 24 22:38:11 GMT+1 2000):

  Mailfilter doesn't break anymore when the bandwidth gets low. Nonblocking
  I/O seems to work as well and provides a better performance when checking
  for e-mail headers on the server.

  Various other little bug fixes have found its way in this release:
  The --mailfilterrc switch works now, MAXSIZE can be set to zero and the
  parsing of the e-mail headers got fixed.

  This version also offers better support for other platforms due to automake
  and provides a better help and version info (thanks to Matthew R. MacIntyre
  for implementing this).  Also changed from a shallow to a deep
  package structure.


mailfilter 0.0.1  (Fri Nov 17 16:10:51 GMT+1 2000):

  Mailfilter's initial version has been released. See TODO for more information
  on this (yet) experimental release.
