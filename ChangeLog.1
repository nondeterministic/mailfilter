Mailfilter ChangeLog
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=

Sun Jul 20 23:09:01 CEST 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * Checked in 0.7 today and opened a branch for it.  It is a
   complete rewrite of *all* mailfilter sources.
 
Wed Feb  5 17:44:22 CET 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * Added --return-value command line switch

 * Set default value for HIGHSCORE to 100
 
 * Updated man pages: mailfilter.1 and mailfilterex.5

Sun Feb  2 19:36:49 CET 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * mailfilter returns 0 if there's no messages on the servers,
   a positive integer otherwise

Thu Jan 30 17:10:46 CET 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * Hopefully fixed parser; ID token definition is back to how it used
   to be in 0.5.0
   
Wed Jan 22 16:33:52 CET 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * Fixed SCORE_CASE and SCORE_NOCASE

Sun Jan 19 12:33:44 CET 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

Wed Jan  1 20:20:51 CET 2003  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * Changed dates in source and Makefiles from 2002 to 2003

Sat Oct 26 19:49:58 EST 2002  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * Added --test to command line options.
 * Readded configure.ac flag for dynamic/static linking.

Fri Oct 25 15:18:07 EST 2002  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

 * autogen.sh: use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS.
 * configure.ac: use AC_CONFIG_HEADERS, AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE w/o args,
   fix brackets, remove PETI_ENABLED_DYNAMIC_LINKING, etc.
 * src/Makefile.am: change YFLAGS

Die Okt  8 17:19:06 CEST 2002 Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>

 * Big changeset. :)
 * Updated to autoconf2.54, automake-1.6, gettext 0.11.5
 * This renames configure.in to configure.ac, so old autoconf's cant
   run anymore. You need the new one!
 * Added every header checks that autoscan suggested to the existing
   ones. Same goes for check_funcs.
 * Added a small macro to configure.ac. Now you are able to build a
   static version of mailfilter with just a configure switch.
 * Removed: acconfig.h, the whole macros subdir.
 * autogen.sh now does the work, it doesnt call another autogen.sh
 * Added subdir m4 with ChangeLog, Makefile.am and
   acinclude.m4. Everything else gets added at autogen.sh runtime.
 * Added Makefile.am to contrib/ and list every file there in EXTRA_DIST
   so they get into the next Release Tarball.
 * Added MakeVars to po/ to make gettext happy.
 * Changed some of the po/*.po files. One was missing a correct Charset
   definition (which breaks things), others just some format errors (%c%s
   in english, --%s in translated). If you are a Translator please adjust
   your file to the newest mailfilter version. And please always change
   the Header with the correct mailfilter version. I have done that for
   the missing ones, inserted 0.3.3 there for now.
 * Updated src/getopt.c src/getopt1.c and src/getopt.h to the newest
   versions.
 * Changed some files in src/ to have PACKAGE_NAME and PACKAGE_VERSION
   instead of NAME and VERSION now, new automake stuff now provides these
   defines.
 * Modified src/Makefile.am to work even if you do VPATH buildings and to
   still not include the autogenerated source in the dist tarball.
 * Now longer run gettextize in autogen.sh, we now use autopoint for that
   work.

Son Okt  6 00:03:04 CEST 2002 Joerg Jaspert <joerg@debian.org>

 * Added contrib/mfdelete.stat from Tim Moore.

   to the doc/ directory


Sun Oct 28 16:08:21 GMT 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@users.sourceforge.net>

    <CR><LF>
    
  * Added some boring debug code to Account.cc

  
Sat Aug 11 21:12:56 CEST 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@users.sourceforge.net>

  * Field-names in e-mail headers may now start with lower case letters, ie

    Mailfilter, yet the translation has to be done though. What's there right
    now is only the configuration and set-up

  * Added normalisation of Subject lines (keyword NORMAL)


Sun Jan 14 17:40:25 GMT+1 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>
  
  * Added regfree() in Preferences.cc to clean up memory taken from all the RE
    stuff

  * Changed pre-compilation of REs from storing results in a temporary buffer
    to writing it directly into the according data structures


Fri Jan 12 20:35:55 GMT+1 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Added error message when the mail server connection could be established
    but the server does not respond to any commands of the client


Sun Jan  7 14:47:11 GMT+1 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Improved logging capabilities. Log file only gets opened once, instead of
    closing and opening it all the time. Also fixed up some error messages.

  * Other bug fixes, mainly to handle situations in which the DELE command
    failed.


Fri Jan  5 20:57:58 GMT+1 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Rewrote large parts of PopAccount.cc to improve error handling. Added
    receiveStatus() to have a very fast function for receiving server status
    messages. The good thing is it doesn't need to throw exceptions either.

  * Fixed obvious linkage problem with standard C header files


Wed Jan  3 19:09:47 GMT+1 2001  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * All Regular Expressions are now only compiled once to speed things up
    drastically

  * All messages get checked immediately instead of storing them first. This is
    to avoid running out of heap memory when huge ammounts of mail arrive

  * Added verbosity level 6 and made filters show up when messages get deleted


Sat Dec 30 14:25:44 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

Thu Dec 28 14:33:25 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Added MAXSIZE_ALLOW and MAXSIZE_DENY keywords. Fixed bugs for the frehsly
    implemented ALLOW keyword.


Wed Dec 27 22:57:34 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Added keyword ALLOW to define messages that should always pass
    the filter


Tue Dec 26 18:01:05 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>
  
  * Added command RSET to the delete() function in PopAccount.cc to avoid
    unnecessary confusion in the mailbox when errors occur during delete


Sun Dec 24 13:19:40 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Removed a potential buffer overflow problem in PopAccount.cc.
    cmd[32] was either removed where possible or increased to cmd[64]
    where necessary. (Thanks to Etienne Herlent for pointing it out.)


Sat Dec 23 10:27:48 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Added keywords DENY_CASE and DENY_NOCASE to make filters more specific
    and to allow better filtering when having ICASE set to 'no'


Tue Dec 19 20:02:06 GMT-5 2000  Matthew R. MacIntyre  <matt@matty.dyndns.org>

  * src/Preferences.cc: added check for malformed keywords: causes
    an error message to be displayed to stderr and the program to be
    exited in error.


Tue Dec 19 16:25:06 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer  <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * It seems Mailfilter was always reading at least one byte more from
    any input streams than allowed. These few extra bytes are now being
    caught and stored and hopefully new versions of glibc like Mailfilter
    a lot more now.

  * Mailfilter now allows ',' in the passwords and complains if the password
    that was sent to the server was incorrect.


Wed Dec 13 15:31:17 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer  <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Found and removed a silly bug that made Mailfilter delete messages
    several times if the e-mails apply to the filters several times.
    Thanks Bob for finding this behaviour in the program!


Sun Dec 10 13:15:56 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer  <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Made Mailfilter compatible with mail servers that use more than a single
    byte stream to send out their response - in particular IMail used on a
    Windows NT box.

  * Clean up of some objects in PopAccount.cc right after use instead
    of calling one big clean-up procedure. Does it fix memory problems?


Fri Dec 8  11:51:21 GMT-5 2000  Matthew R. MacIntyre  <matt@matty.dyndns.org>

  * src\Preferences.cc, src\Preferences.hh, src\PopAccount.cc:
    Applied patch created by Ivan Vitjuk to allow case-insensitive
    regular expression matching in the .mailfilterrc file.
	

Tue Dec  5 13:20:56 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer  <baueran@in.tum.de>

  * Mailfilter now properly recognizes the end of an e-mail header with
    isHeaderEnd() - the closing CRLF was not read before

  * Again, rewrote major parts of the I/O routines after discovering another
    serious memory leak in them

  * Applied a patch to Mailfilter which fixes a problem reading the program's
    preferences. Thanks Ivan!

  * Fixed a bug that Mailfilter would delete messages that exceeded the
    MAXSIZE limit, but wouldn't report it in the log nor on the screen


Fri Nov 24 13:32:16 GMT+1 2000  Andreas Bauer  <baueran@in.tum.de>
  
  * Fixed a _major_ problem with I/O. Mailfilter doesn't break anymore
    under heavy network traffic mainly due to a complete rewrite of the
    part dealing with nonblocking access

  * I/O is much faster now

  * Parsing of messages fixed. The last line of the e-mail header used to lose
    its last few characters

  * Changed Mailfilter output slightly

  * Fixed problem with MAXSIZE. Messages got deleted when MAXSIZE was not
    set

  * Fixed lnsl issue. Mailfilter now compiles and runs under Solaris and Irix
    again and according to Matt also on FreeBSD

  * Changed from LICENSE to COPYING - more GNU compliant

  * Changed INSTALL and FAQ


Tue Nov 21 21:10:23 GMT+1 2000  Matthew R. MacIntyre  <mrmacint@chat.carleton.ca>

  * Fixed issue with getopt. It is now always compiled in, no matter whether
    it's preinstalled or not; works for FreeBSD

  * Included lsocket and lnsl in configure.in; somehow lnsl is still broken
    though

  * Created PopAccount.cc, PopAccount.hh.
    Restructured source code to a more object oriented layout.
    PopAccount is now derived from a virtual class Account that
    takes care of storing headers as this should be the same for all
    kind of accounts, protocols, etc.

  * Fixed a small problem with the --mailfilterrc switch
    (thanks to Tobias Ebner for reporting this problem)

  * Improved help and version info

  * Improved error handling

  * Introduced automake to Mailfilter (does not work for Solaris yet)
