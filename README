Mailfilter README
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-

Mailfilter is a flexible utility for Unix-like operating systems to
get rid of unwanted spam mails, before having to go through the
trouble of downloading them into the local computer.  It offers
support for one or many POP accounts and is especially useful for
dialup connections via modem, ISDN, etc.

Mailfilter connects to any POP mail box and compares part of its
content to a set of user defined filter rules.  That way the spam gets
deleted directly on the mail server.

With Mailfilter you can define your own filters (rules) to determine
which e-mails should be delivered and which are considered waste.
Rules are regular expressions, so you can make use of familiar options
from other mail delivery programs such as e.g. procmail.

Mailfilter is released under the terms of the GNU General Public
License.  For more information, see the COPYING file provided with the
Mailfilter program.
